# State Management Explanation

## Choice of State Management

The project uses React Query for state management. Here are the reasons for choosing React Query:

1. **Data Fetching and Caching**: React Query simplifies data fetching and caching, making it easy to manage server state.

2. **Automatic Refetching**: It automatically refetches data in the background, ensuring that the UI is always up-to-date with the latest data.

3. **Optimistic Updates**: React Query supports optimistic updates, allowing for a smooth user experience by updating the UI before the server confirms the changes.

4. **Developer Experience**: The library provides a great developer experience with features like query invalidation, pagination, and infinite scrolling.

5. **Community and Support**: React Query has a strong community and is well-maintained, providing confidence in its long-term viability.

Overall, React Query was chosen for its ability to handle complex data fetching scenarios with ease and its focus on improving the developer experience.
